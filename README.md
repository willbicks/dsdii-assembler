# âš™ DSDII Assembler

DSDII Assembler parses MIPS instructions and generates machine code in various formats for a processor developed in RIT's Digital Systems Design II class. The class focuses on the VHDL and Verilog implementation of the processor itself, and this exercise is purely a personal side project.

## Features

#### Instruction Parsing:
- [x] R type instructions
- [x] I type instructions
- [ ] J type instructions (not implemented in our processor)
- [x] Pseudo instructions (`nop`, `clear`, `move`)
- [ ] Load immediate (pseudo `li`)
- [ ] Support for comments and blank lines
#### Output Formatting:
- [x] Raw hex machine code output
- [ ] VHDL code generation (byte addressable memory)
- [ ] VHDL code generation (word addressable memory)

## Usage

```shell
$ dsdii-assembler --help

Usage of dsdii-assembler:
  -i string
        Input file containing assembly instrucitons.
  -nop-buff uint
        Optional number of nop instructions to include after each instruciton.
  -o string
        Output file to write machine code to. (default "stdout")
  -ofmt string
        Output format (hex, vhdl-byte, vhdl-word). (default "hex")
```
